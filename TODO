Post-1.0:
"StageSelector" node that manages the loading and unloading of stages (with backgrounds), keeps an array of them
Laser bullets
Connected entities (behaving as "ship parts")
Particle FX on spawn, destroy, despawn
Particle FX can be triggered manually with a defined function to stop/start the particle effect (Change emission state with one function?)
Persistent entity checkbox (exists even outside of screen)
Replace "Follow" path with any SpawnResource
Move PlayerEntity's control scheme to PlayerResource
Place spawner's despawn item on last killed entity's position
Phase change animations (predefined names could be phase[n] where n = new phase number, make invul during animation)
Collision shape changes per phase (null = no change)
Possible resource creator tab from a node? (Pulling data from a provided entity node's child collision node, Sprite node, etc)
